# Yelp-Search-Full-Stack-Project
This is a full stack project that uses Yelp api to perform business search, recommendation and reservation.
I've developed a web application version and an Android app version.

The link to the web application is: https://angular-project-53460.wl.r.appspot.com/search

The video demo for the Android app is below:

For academic integrity reason, the source code were asked to not be uploaded to a public github repository, however, I can provide the source code upon request.
Thank you for your understanding!
